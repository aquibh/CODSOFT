<b>Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction</b><br><br>
This project involves building a predictive model using the Titanic dataset to determine the survival likelihood of passengers. The dataset provides detailed passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. This classic machine-learning task is ideal for beginners and serves as an introduction to data handling, feature engineering, and model training. The goal is to apply logistic regression or other suitable classification methods to predict survival outcomes effectively.<br><br>

<b>Task 2: Iris Flower Classification</b><br><br>
This task focuses on developing a machine-learning model capable of classifying Iris flowers into three species—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—based on the dimensions of their sepals and petals. Utilizing the well-known Iris dataset, this project serves as a foundational exercise in machine learning, specifically in classification techniques. The objective is to train a model that accurately identifies the species of Iris flowers from their physical measurements using algorithms like k-nearest neighbors or support vector machines.<br><br>

<b>Task 3: Sales Prediction Using Python</b><br><br>
In this project, the goal is to forecast sales by analyzing various factors such as advertising spend, audience segmentation, and platform choice using Python and machine learning techniques. The task involves preprocessing data, selecting features, and employing regression models to predict future sales volumes. This project not only enhances understanding of data science applications in business but also prepares one for complex analytical challenges by providing insights into effective advertising strategies and decision-making processes.<br><br>
